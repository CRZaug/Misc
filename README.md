# Data structures and algorithms problems

## Goal:

Learn data structures and algorithms through _Cracking the Coding Interview_. Since Python was my first real language, many solutions are implemented in Python. However, I am trying to learn C and C++ as well, so some are implemented in these languages as well.

## Problems:

### Algorithms

#### FizzBuzz

Classic problem. If a multiple of 3, print Fizz. If a multiple of 5, print Buzz. If a multiple of 15, pring Fizz Buzz

#### Contiguous Subarray

Find the largest continuous subarray in an array. Uses dynamic programming

#### Least Coins

Make change with the fewest coins possible (working solution depends on the American monetary system)

#### Sort

Check if an array is sorted using recursion

#### isUnique

Check if a string is unique (two solutions with different runtimes)

#### removeDups

Remove duplicates from a linked list

#### stringPermutation

Check if two strings are permutations of one another

#### arrayJumps
Figure out the minimum number of steps to make it to the end of an array. Moves
can be made 1 or 2 places. Cannot "land" on 1.

#### repeatedChar
Given an infinitely repeating string containing the letter a, find out how many
times a appears in a substring of length n

#### swapSortArray
Given an array in which a value can move forward (and only forward) only twice, changing 
places with the value "ahead" of it, give the minimum number of swaps possible
to sort the array. 

#### mutualSubstring
Determine if two strings have ANY mutual substring, including a single character.


### Data Structures

#### Linked List

Implement a linked list

#### Stack

Implement a stack via linked lists

#### Queue

Implement a queue via linked lists
